# Battleship Game Final Project
 
_This battleship game is run based on conditions input via reading the_ "BattleData" _file._

_Edit the file to change settings about the game such as board size, number of ships, and size of ships._

_Default values for the game is a board size of 10 with 5 ships sizes [2, 2, 3, 3, 4]._

_This project also uses the following libraries:_

_- miniaudio: https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio_

_We used Miniaudio to add sounds to the game flow. There are 6 total sounds including background music._

_- matplotplusplus: https://github.com/alandefreitas/matplotplusplus_

_We used matplot++ for a data analytic visualization of the ratio of hits to misses by both the computer and the player._
